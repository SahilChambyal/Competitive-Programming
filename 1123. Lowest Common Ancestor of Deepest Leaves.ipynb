    "Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.\n",

    "\n",
    "The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children\n",
    "The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.\n",
    "The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.\n",
